<h1>NKM</h1>

<p>A local multiplayer turn-based strategy game on a hex board.</p>

<p>Made with C# (Unity as frontend)</p>

<h2>About</h2>

<p>This is my first bigger project. I learned a lot here.
This game was rewritten many times, as you may see in commit history.
Every time I wanted to add a new feature, a new problem would arise.
Hopefully I&rsquo;m good enough now to stop rewriting the game and start developing!</p>

<h2>How the game works</h2>

<p>You can read about it in the <a href="https://github.com/tojatos/NKM/blob/master/docs/GameRules.md">Game Rules</a> section.
It will be improved later.</p>

<h2>Where is the code?!</h2>

<p><code>Assets/Scripts/</code> - all code</p>

<p><code>Assets/Scripts/Unity</code> - frontend code</p>

<p><code>Assets/Scripts/NKMCore</code> - backend code</p>

<p><code>Assets/Scripts/NKMCore/Templates/</code> - some important files, such as Ability.cs and Character.cs</p>

<p><code>Assets/Scripts/NKMCore/Abilities/</code> - fun stuff - character abilities</p>

<h2>Running / building the game</h2>

<p>To run the game simply clone the project and open it in Unity (should work in 2018.1+).
You can build using Unity&rsquo;s usual way (ctrl+B), using <code>Developement</code> on the toolbar, or using script in root folder (BuildLinux.sh or BuildWindows.cmd).</p>

<p>Make sure that in the Main Game scene IsTesting is not selected in Game Starter object.</p>

<p>Warning: the game may not work properly on Windows due to a bug with directory names. This will be fixed after decoupling (soon&trade;)</p>

<h2>Future</h2>

<p>Right now I am focused on decoupling and writing tests.
In the future I&rsquo;d like to add multiplayer mode, support for mobile devices, better documentation for contributing and a website.</p>
