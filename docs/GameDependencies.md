# Game dependencies

In order to start the game, we need to provide some dependencies to it:

* List of players with characters
* Map
* Game type (is that a local or online game?)
* Character placing type (should they be placed by players before game start or placed randomly on spawns?) 
* Selectable (what should be used to select things, like characters to place?)
* Selectable manager (what is used to manage selectables)
* Selectable action (special action used for selectables, is used even before game starts for character pick)
