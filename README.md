# NKM

A multiplayer turn-based strategy game on a hex board.

Made with C# (Unity as frontend)

## About

This is my first bigger project. I learned a lot here.
This game was rewritten many times, as you may see in commit history.
Every time I wanted to add a new feature, a new problem would arise.

And I overcame them.

## How the game works

You can read about it in the [Game Rules](https://github.com/tojatos/NKM/blob/master/docs/GameRules.md) section.
It will be improved later.

## Where is the code?!

`Assets/Scripts/` - all code

`Assets/Scripts/NKMObjects/Templates/` - some important files, such as Ability.cs and Character.cs

`Assets/Scripts/NKMObjects/Abilities/` - fun stuff, character abilities

## Running / building the game

To run the game simply clone the project and open it in Unity (should work in 2018.1+).
You can build using Unity's usual way (ctrl+B), using `Developement` on the toolbar, or using script in root folder (BuildLinux.sh or BuildWindows.cmd).
